,Actian Hostiles - Mantis - Alternative,,,,Five Of Eleven,,Gorkon,,Khan,,Put SNW La'an below deck for extra cargo space if needed. Stack Health for Five of Eleven. This crew gives good survivability by increasing your own mitigation and extra Loot from Five of Eleven and takes advantage of the 100% critical hit chance exo comp with gorkon providing Hull Breach to kill the hostiles quicker.

,Armada - Eclipse alternative,,,,Beverly Crusher,,Khan,,Lorca,,"Stack Health and Defence for Beverley. Beverley offers both shield regeneration and mitigation. Khan and lorca combined offer the ability to deal huge damage with increase in Critical chance and hull breach. This crew will need stella research to be quite advanced M50+ roughly.

,Armadas - 5/6/Miles,,,,Five Of Eleven,,Six Of Eleven,,Miles O'Brien,,"Stack Health and Attack. Miles will be effective at lower than the reccomended level but far more potent from rank 3. Great alternative for all armadas as Miles will increase all shots.

,Armadas - DS9  - Sisko/Miles/Changeling Kira,,,,Benjamin Sisko,,Miles O'Brien,,Changeling Kira,,"Stack Attack for Kira and Health for Sisko. Miles will be effective at lower than the reccomended level but far more potent from rank 3. Sisko Full Synergy, Offers a Higher mitigation boost than 5 of eleven, and this may be over kill as the limit is c. 71.2%. if you can get to that figure with one side of synergy, consider swapping out Kira for another officer such as Khan, lorca or six of eleven (if using six, then would need to stack some attack to increase effectivness)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Armadas - Early Level - Burning (No Epics),,,,Arix,,Kumak,,Vemet,,"Basic Burning Crew, Arix is first officer you will likely unlock which can proc burning and 2 sides of synergy help to increase this chance.

,Armadas - Early Level - Hull Breach (No Epics),,,,Azetbur,,Kerla,,M'Ral,,"Basic Breach crew, needs Azetbur to Proc breach and needs your ship to have a kinetic weapon. Synergy with other officers increase its effectiveness while offering additional bonuses from their respective abilities.

,Armadas - Max Crit Damage reducer (Picard),,,,Jean-Luc Picard,,Beverly Crusher,,Gaila,,Gaila Must be MAXED for best results. added benefit over using the pike version of this crew due to the Crit damage officer ability from Picard. This crew reduces critical DAMAGE (different to Critical hit CHANCE). multiple may be required to fully remove all damage when fighting armadas.

,Armadas - Max Loot,,,,Geordi La Forge,,Beverly Crusher,,Five Of Eleven,,"ONLY use this crew if you are sure of victory as it offers very little by means of attack abilities and you are using the standard ship power. Provides the highest loot multiplyer available from armadas. Beverley can be swapped to the appropriate anti faction officer within the  TNG crew group as long as not also engineering class, which would reduce the synergy and therefore loot received.

,"Armadas - Sisko, Miles & Six",,,,Benjamin Sisko,,Miles O'Brien,,Six Of Eleven,,"Stack Health for Sisko and Attack for Six. This crew provided Massive mitigation from Sisko aswell as increased Crit Chance. Miles adds extra shots and the higher the Tier the better!! Six increases Piercing stats.

,Armadas - Troi crit reducer - Exchange Armadas,,,,Deanna Troi,,Data,,Khan,,Exchange armadas have a crit chance of 20% this crew will remove all critical shots thrown by the armada as troi will have one side of Synergy.
